# Olutrekisteri

This is my practical work of Programming 2 course from 2017. It is a simple register (in Finnish) for saving notes of tasted beers.

Databases (one for beers, one for notes) are simple text-based .dat files. They are located in the folder "olutrekisteri", **which must be located in the same directory as executable .jar file.**
